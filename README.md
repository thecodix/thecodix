## Hi, I'm Alfredo 👋

I'm a Senior Python Developer with over 15 years of experience building scalable backend systems and leading engineering teams. My recent work has focused on the intersection of cryptocurrency and cloud-native architecture.

In my latest role, I worked on a high-performance payment system using Django, FastAPI, and Docker. I also contributed to infrastructure automation using Terraform and built CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.

🛠️ **Current Focus:**  
- Python & Backend Architecture  
- Terraform & Cloud Infrastructure  
- GitHub Actions & CI/CD  
- Cryptocurrency Integrations  

📈 Always learning. Currently deepening my DevOps skills.
